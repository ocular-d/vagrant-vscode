<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This is a demo of how to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Link to website") for technical (API) writing.

VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is running on top of an [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop "Website of Ubuntu Desktop") configured with [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery "Link to website with VSCode extensions") for writing.

### Requirements

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Link to website of Vagrant")
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Link to website of Git")
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "Link to VirtualBox")

## Usage

### Getting started

First make sure that you have all [requirements](#requirements) installed.

Now open a terminal and *clone* the repository:

```shell
git clone https://ocular-d/vagrant-vscode
```

Change into that directory:

```shell
cd vagrant-vscode
```

Start the setup process by starting vagrant:

```shell
vagrant up
```

The first time running `vagrant up` will install and setup all required vagrant plugins.

After the first run is finished, please run `vagrant up` for a second time.

Now you will see the boot process starting.

Depending on your bandwidth, this can take some minutes.
